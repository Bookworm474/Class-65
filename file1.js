Once upon a time,here was a princess named Snow White who lived in the forest with her friends, the seven dwarves. One day, an old lady came to Snow White and gave her an apple. Trusting the old hag, Snow ate the apple and fell into eternal slumber.
Moral of the story: Do not trust strangers.
But there was more to it than that. Snow White was once the princess of a powerful kingdom, and the old hag her beautiful stepmother.
